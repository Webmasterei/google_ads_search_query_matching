# Google Ads Search Query Matching Script
## Use of the Script
The Script compares all search queries from a Google Ads Account, compares them with active keywords and only puts them into the sheet if the keyword is not yet booked.
Caution! This is the MCC Version of the Script.
## Changelog
v1.1 Due to Googles change in keyword matches the script lost in use. Attempt to fix that usability loss with bringing the matchType to the sheet.
v1.0 (somewhat 2016)
